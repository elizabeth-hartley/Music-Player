# Description

This project created the back end 'API' for a music player app. It extracts artist, album and song data from a mySQL database and returns the required JSON to integrate with a supplied front end.
By tracking the number of times a song was played, the most popular albums can be displayed. Additionally functionality includes the users ability to favourite a song and search for a specific song.
The project was built in an OOP style using PHP.
